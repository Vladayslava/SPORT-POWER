                    Toning exercises are exercises aimed at strengthening and toning muscles, 
                    as well as increasing overall body tone. This includes using light dumbbells, elastic bands, low-weight aerobic exercises,
                     and other methods. These exercises help burn excess calories and increase muscle mass, which contributes to maintaining 
                     a healthy weight and controlling it. Regular toning workouts can contribute to improving overall health, 
                    including improving metabolism, reducing stress levels, and enhancing sleep quality.</div>

                <div class="text">Dancing offers comprehensive exercises that improve endurance, flexibility, strength, and coordination. This helps strengthen muscles, 
                    improve posture, and overall health. Dance includes various styles and techniques, such as hip-hop, Zumba, contemporary dance,
                     and others. All workouts are conducted in the gym with experienced instructors. Participation in group dance classes or 
                     team competitions promotes socialization, helps develop teamwork skills, and establishes new connections with people who 
                     share common interests.

                <div class="text">Cardio workouts are exercises aimed at improving the function of the cardiovascular system and 
                    increasing the body's endurance. They involve activities that elevate heart rate and require increased breathing. 
                    Examples of cardio workouts include running, walking, swimming, cycling, aerobics, and other high-intensity activities. 
                    Regular cardio workouts improve the quality of oxygen exchange and energy processes in the body, 
                    leading to increased endurance and overall physical fitness.</div>

                <div class="text">
                    High-intensity workouts are exercises performed with high intensity and often maximum effort. This includes short 
                    periods of intense activity followed by periods of rest or lighter activity. Intense workouts contribute to active calorie 
                    burning during the workout as well as prolonged increase in metabolism after the workout. 
                    They help increase muscle strength and endurance, leading to overall improvement in physical fitness.</div>

                <div class="lessons_headings"><h2>Wellness</h2></div>
                <div class="text">The feeling of well-being and energy that comes from an active lifestyle and proper nutrition allows 
                    people to work better, communicate effectively, and enjoy life overall. Engaging in sports and physical exercises 
                    strengthens muscles, improves endurance and flexibility, as well as reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases, obesity, 
                    and other ailments. Regular workouts contribute to the production of endorphins - hormones of joy and happiness, 
                    which help cope with stress, anxiety, and depression.</div>
